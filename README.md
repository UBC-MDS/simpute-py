### What does it do?
Have you ever had a time when your missing data was holding you back? Well then this package is for you!

Our python package for simple data imputation will allow you to quickly and seamlessly impute any missing data (be numeric, categorical, date/time or boolean values) using any large datasets. All you have to do is follow these simple 4 steps:
(1) Import the data you wish you impute
(2) Select the method of imputation (this will depend on the datatype, read the functions below for more details)
(3) Run the package
(4) Save your newly imputed dataset

The novelty here is our speciality "random" imputation generator which will aim to imitate your data so that you create a brand new datasets with no missing values. This will be great for all types of testing. And can be used easily to get your data in a ready to use condition.
